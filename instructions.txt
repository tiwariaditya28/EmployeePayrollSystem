# Employee Payroll Management System - Instructions

## Database Setup

The Employee Payroll Management System database has been successfully set up with:
- Normalized database schema with 19 tables
- Sample data with at least 15 records in each table
- SQL queries for data analysis

## How to Use the System

1. The database schema has already been created using the `simplified_schema.sql` script.
2. Sample data has been loaded from the following files:
   - `sample_data_part1.sql`
   - `sample_data_part2.sql`
   - `sample_data_part3.sql`
   - `sample_data_part4.sql`

3. To run the entire setup again, use the batch file:
   ```
   .\run_db_setup.bat
   ```

4. To run the employee compensation analysis query, use:
   ```
   .\run_query.bat
   ```

5. To run other queries, you can use the MySQL command line:
   ```
   mysql -u root -p"your_password" -e "USE EmployeePayrollDB; SELECT * FROM Table;"
   ```
   
   Or you can run queries from the `queries.sql` file using:
   ```
   mysql -u root -p"your_password" -D EmployeePayrollDB < queries.sql
   ```

The database includes:
- Strong entities (Department, Employee, Job, etc.)
- Weak entities (Attendance, Dependent)
